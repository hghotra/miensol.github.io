On Windows there is the great <a href=\"http://fiddler2.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fiddler</a>. While it&#x2019;s possible to use Fiddler on other platforms using virtualization software I think it&#x2019;s an overkill. Fortunately there are alternatives. <a href=\"http://www.charlesproxy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Charles</a> looks like\n  the most advanced one offering most if not all features available in Fiddler. There is also a little less popular <a href=\"http://www.tuffcode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP Scoop</a>. Both Charles and HTTP Scoop aren&#x2019;t free but in my opinion they are worth\n  the price especially if used often. Command line lovers might find <a href=\"http://mitmproxy.org/\" target=\"_blank\">mitmproxy</a> suit their needs. If you only need basic features <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ngrok</a> might serve you well.\n  To dive a bit deeper and see http traffic on a tcp level <a href=\"http://www.wireshark.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WireShark</a> is indispensable.</p>\n<p>As you can see there are plenty of tools available to help understand what is happening on http level. As I was learning about http caching a question popped to my head. How hard would it be to actually build a simple http sniffer?</p>\n<h2>proxy-mirror &#x2013; a simple http inspector</h2>\n<p>As it turned out it&#x2019;s actually not that hard to built one thus <a href=\"https://github.com/miensol/proxy-mirror\" target=\"_blank\">proxy-mirror</a> came to be. Of course this is a very simplistic http sniffer &#x2013; nowhere near to tools I mentioned above both\n  in terms of features and reliability &#x2013; but it works (at least in most scenarios :-)). It&#x2019;s open source and I learned couple of new things about HTTP while implementing it &#x2013; more on that in future posts. Here are some screen shoots of the the tool:\n  <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/miensol/proxy-mirror/master/misc/screenshot-landscape.png\" width=\"603\" height=\"367\">&#xA0;</p>\n<p>\n  <img src=\"https://raw.github.com/miensol/proxy-mirror/master/misc/screenshot-portrait.png\" width=\"609\" height=\"652\">\n</p>\n<p>As you might have guessed from screenshots proxy-mirror is a web application. Right now it&#x2019;s not very easy to try it out &#x2013; the instructions are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/miensol/proxy-mirror\" target=\"_blank\">Readme</a> &#x2013; I&#x2019;ll try to fix it soon.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>I wanted to run proxy-mirror on many platforms and rely on a foundation that has both great support for http and building web applications. I picked node.js over java or ruby mainly because I wanted to sharpen my skills in it.</p>\n<p>You can think of proxy-mirror as 2 logical components. The first is a regular http proxy that you can use by configuring your browser or system. I didn&#x2019;t want to focus on building that first so I utilized a great node module call <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy\" target=\"_blank\">http-proxy</a>. With it&#x2019;s helped you can have a system wide proxy in couple of minutes. The http proxy component emits events whenever a request or response goes through it. Those events are consumed by the second logical component &#x2013;\n  a web application built with <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/?utm_source=buffer&amp;utm_campaign=Buffer&amp;utm_content=buffer73c90&amp;utm_medium=google\" target=\"_blank\">express.js</a>. The information about http traffic received from events is then pushed\n  to browser part through <a href=\"http://socket.io/\" target=\"_blank\">socket.io</a> where a simple SPA built with <a href=\"http://miensol.blogspot.com/2013/09/angularjs-my-new-superhero-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\">my beloved</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AngularJS</a> displays information about them.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>Right now proxy-mirror has only couple of features:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>http and https support &#x2013; although the latter one requires additional setup</li>\n  <li>simple session list &#x2013; a <a href=\"http://angular-ui.github.io/ng-grid/\" target=\"_blank\">grid</a> with list of request/response pairs that you can inspect</li>\n  <li>a detailed view &#x2013; both for request and response that can display headers, message body and a preview right in the browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although it still is a very simple (and buggy) application I actually found that it has most of features I frequently use &#x2013; probably except for filtering. Maybe someday it will become a reasonable alternative for Charles - at least for me.</p>\n<p>I think building an http sniffer is a great exercise in the process of learning how http(s) works. I guess the famous saying about journey being more more important than the destination fits nice here.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/building-http-sniffer-with-nodejs/","tagSlugs":["/tag/javascript/","/tag/http/","/tag/angularjs/","/tag/node-js/","/tag/express-js/","/tag/https/","/tag/proxy/"]},"excerpt":"","frontmatter":{"date":"2014-01-01 22:14:00","description":null,"tags":["javascript","http","angularjs","node.js","express.js","https","proxy"],"title":"Building an HTTP sniffer with node.js","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/building-http-sniffer-with-nodejs/"}}}
